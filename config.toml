    bio = "<br/><strong>Senior GIS Software Developer working remotely from Boone, NC for Patrick Engineering.</strong><br/><br/>I enjoy working with open source technologies though I’m highly proficient in all things ESRI. I prefer to work in multiple languages and constantly learn new ones, but my day to day work is typically full-stack web development in JavaScript, Python, and C#. I’m searching for a project to learn Go!"
