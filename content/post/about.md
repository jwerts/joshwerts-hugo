**Senior GIS Software Developer working remotely from Asheville, NC for Patrick Engineering.**  

I entered software development from a diverse background of civil engineering, land surveying and forestry (GIS emphasis). Other than a few fundamental programming courses taken during my Masters degree, I'm a self-taught developer. In a constantly changing field, I see this as an advantage. I'm passionate about software (especially GIS/spatial/mapping) and truly driven by learning.  

I enjoy working with open source technologies though I'm highly proficient in all things ESRI. I prefer to work in multiple languages and constantly learn new ones, but my day to day work is typically full-stack web development in JavaScript, Python, and C#.  I'm searching for a project to learn Go!  

When I'm not programming, I'm a mountain biker, whitewater kayaker, snowboarder, and backpacker.
